Title : Online Test


Screen 1: Landing page [Brand Image + Rules/Protocols + Button to enter into the test]

Screen 2: A div in which one question will display at a time. There will be a next button when user click on it then
next question should appear. There should be a back button to go to previous ques.

Screen 3: Once user will submit the test in a new page result of test should display & in bottom all questions with correct answer should display.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: We should have a question bank (questions.json) in which say 50 questions will be there.

Step 2: We need to create a function which will read questions.json, and return 15 random questions
[
	{
		id:1,
		ques: "What is JS"
		options: ["programming Lang","Graphics Tool", "ML Algo", "DevOps Tool"]
		answer: 0,
		topic: "JS"
	},
	{},
	{}
]
 
Step 3: Let's create the Screen1 using HTML and CSS

Step 4: We can set a index variable as 0 & fetch the question/record which exist in current index & display it in UI

Step 5: When user will click on next button then increase index by 1 and display the question in UI which is in current 
index, vice versa in case user click on back button.

let userResponse = [
	{
	ques_no:1,
	candidate_ans: 0,
	isCorrect: true
	},
	{
	ques_no:2,
	candidate_ans: 3,
	isCorrect: false
	}
	...
]


Step 6: When user will submit the test, result page will open in which obtained score will display.

Step 7: At the bottom of result page, we need to display all questions with right answers.
